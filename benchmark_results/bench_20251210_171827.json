The predicted actions focus on turning on the stove and preparing ingredients broadly, whereas the ground truth is specifically about picking up a cucumber and placing it on the cutting board. While there is some overlap due to the cooking context, the key action of 'pick up a cucumber and place it on the cutting board' is missed.",
